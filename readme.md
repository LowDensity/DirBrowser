#  DirViewer for IIS
## About
This repository is meant to beautify and add features for IIS(Internet Information Service) directory listing page.
The page used bootstrap4 and bootstrap-table to provide neccessary features.

## Background

The repository was originally inspired by one of my IT friends need for a super light-weight file sharing service without using SAMBA(SMB),for unknown reason.
The reason for me to do this is just for fun and to challenge myself. And in hope I could have helped him on his work.

## This page is only for IIS.

I once hoped I could have a universal beautifier.

But the style of directory listing page is far more distinguished than my imagination.

IIS , though, produced by tech giant Microsoft , uses the most primitive way to present directory listing page than other.

## No tables , just pure text and an \<a\> tag.

And caused existence of this repository.

Other famous Web Server like Apache Tomcat / Apache HTTPD uses \<table\>  for diretory listing. 


The only thing  one will have to do is to grab the correct column in a \<tr\>.

Since IIS is the only server application known to use such a primitive way to present the listing page. There's no way this can be universal.
