                    An almost usesless application(But it's fun and educational). <br>
                    Which helps one of my IT friend to solve his problem.<br>
                    An online demo can be found  <a href="browser.html">here</a>.<br>

                One day, my IT friend(IT-friend afterward) PM me asking how he 
                could "Run a script on client from server."
                It was a ridiculous request for anyone with a basic level of knowledge of
                how things work. 
                WTF are you talking about ?
                After the entire afternoon of messaging, it turned out that he wants to 
                use his computer as a CDN,so he could use scripts files located on his 
                computer to perform his job.
                I first think of using SMB. 
                It was rejected for the need of changing a system setting than reset 
                it after things are done.
                IT-friend then came to the conclusion that a web page is best suited for this job.
                What ? How ? 
                Firstly, his company assigned him a windows laptop, and it is super easy to setup IIS.
                Second, ports 80/443 for http/https are not blocked by default on most computer.So you don't
                have to change setting first and reset them after things are done.
                It's alomost perfect solution.
                Quite ingenious , isn't it.
                
                The only problem is that he doesn't like the default looking of the default directory-listing page
                and wants to customize it.
                
                Seems no problem.
                There's nothing I can do for you ,enjoy and , good luck.

                But later he encountered a problem : Where to start ? Where can I set styles for the Directory 
                listing page ? 

                The answer is "somewhere in dll ,  nowhere"
                So, it turned out that it is un-relistic to change default style of directory listing page.
                If you can't change , why don't you create a new one embedding the original one?

                It is this problem which led to the question "How can I Run a script on client from server."
                It is actually "How can I run a script on server to create directory listing page."
                He spent quite sometime google for solutions. 
                Seeing that him completely lost, going absolutely wrong direction,talking about 
                killing flys with cannon stuff.
                I ran out of patience and decided to do a demo which would give him a direction.  
                This, is the reason of how this application is created.

            <h2>How should this work?</h2>
            <h4>
                The answer is simple , if we can't change original, 
                then we make new one embedding it, with Iframe.
                The plan is that we have new html file called browser.html which contains an iframe 
                with its "src" set to directory listing page.
                On Iframe's "onload" event, we grab the content inside ,parse it into Javascript Object  
                and use them.

            <h2>Initial Research</h2>
            <h4>
                After the structure is decided,I began my own research.
                The IIS directory-listing page looks like this:
                <img src="pictures/democontent_02.jpg" alt="pictures/democontent_02.jpg"/>
                The structure for this page is quite simple,
                <img src="pictures/democontent_03.jpg" alt="pictures/democontent_03.jpg"/>
                You can completely ignore the H1 of localhost.
                However , it becomes crazy after extending the "pre" tag. 
                <img src="pictures/democontent_04.jpg" alt="how it looks like inside pre tag"/>
                It's a mass inside. Does there exists any order ? 
                Yes there is ,IT-friend found it hard to understand an gave up analyzing the 
                structure soon after seeing this.
                I kept going.
                
                The biggest problem here is the mixing of tag and plaintext, and not splitting 
                "go to upper level" link with other content(if they did this , the job would be
                much easier).
                But there is still order in it. See any clues?
                The "a" tag. Every entries are an a tag in it.  
                We can grab all "a" tags as an anchor , and easily skip "go to parent directory" by 
                starting loop index from 1 instead of 0.

                We can get filename and exact url from the "a" tag. 
                But what about filesize and last-modified date ?

                They can be acceessed through tag.previousSibling, but how can I separate them ? 

                This is apparently a situation for Regular Expression.
                I used "2 continuous space " as an anchor. It didn't work out well because the space
                between last-modified-date and filesize is not necceisarily 2 spaces, they can be 1.
                But using 1 space to split meant nothing. 
                By doing so , you  also tear apart the last-modified-date.
                
                Using a regex for datetime is a possible choice. But IIS displays datetime to
                the timezone set on server computer. The Reg-Exp will be terribly long just to 
                describe one format, not to mention a Reg-Exp that can check many time formats.

                How about going reverse , see if there is something missing ?
                Datetime ... filesize... 
                Yes , awesome, the filesize is always in Bytes and is a pure string of digits!
                So,instead of recognizing the datetime format, we simply recognize the 
                filesize string and remove them from original string.
                After that , time for datetime-libraries!
                
                And then , we got everything in directory-listing-page into a JS object.
                
                Now we can use those data. In this case , I put them into Bootstrap-table.
                But this is just a demo to show that you can do it this way , you can always 
                use them the way you like.
